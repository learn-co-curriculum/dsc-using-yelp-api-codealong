    "Twitter is a great source for mining of data as almost every Twitter user’s tweets are  public and retrievable. This allows great opportunities for data scientists trying to get a large amount of data to run analytical experiments on. Twitter data is also very concise and specific, which makes it very easy to process it in order to get some insights. Twitter’s API allows complex queries like pulling every tweet about a certain topic, specify time intervals to suit the focus of analysis or pull a certain user’s most retweeted tweets etc.\n",
